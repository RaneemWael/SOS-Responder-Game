# SOS-Responder-Game
A playable SOS responder game coded in Java where the player deploys rescue units to certain disasters appearing in a 10x10 grid displayed on the screen.

## Description:

The Rescue Simulation is based on concepts of the RoboCup, an annual international robotics competition proposed and founded in 1996 by a group of university professors.

The aim of rescue simulations is to derive strategies and behaviors for maximizing the number of saved lives and minimizing the number of casualties. The hope is that one day these strategies can be applied by actual policemen, firefighters and medics in real life disasters and accidents.

- The game consists of a main simulation 10x10 grid where the whole map is taking place.
- The game is a single player one, where the player is responsible for managing the rescue units to handle buildings and citizens suffering from the disasters that ensue during gameplay throughout the whole map. 
- The main goal of the game is for the player to efficiently employ the rescue units to rescue as many citizens and minimize the number of deaths. 
- All the available rescue units are assigned to the player at the start of the simulation. 
- As the game proceeds certain disasters start appearing throughout the map affecting different buildings and citizens.
